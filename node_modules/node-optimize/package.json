  "readme": "node-optimize\n=============\n\n[![npm Version](https://badge.fury.io/js/node-optimize.png)](https://npmjs.org/package/node-optimize)\n\nWe all need a tool to optimize a node.js project and create a single `js` file from it, \nTaking care of `require`s and leaving out `node_modules`.\n\nWell I needed one too, and there wasn't one, so I build it!\n\nUsage:\n```javascript\n\n\tvar NodeOptimizer = require('node-optimize');\n\tvar optimizer = new NodeOptimizer({ \n\t\tignore: [\n\t\t\t'config/db.js',\n\t\t\t'private/some-other-file.js',\n\t\t]\n\t});\n\t\n    var mergedJs = optimizer.merge('main.js'); // node-optimize will automatically resolve that path for 'main.js' using path.resolve(...)\n\t\n\trequire('fs').writeFile(require('path').resolve('main.optimized.js'), mergedJs);\n\t\n```\n\n## What's in the bag\n\n* `options.ignore` -> Tell it which files to ignore in the process of expanding the `require` calls.\n* Automatically ignores core modules, or modules from `node_modules`.\n* Currently handles `*.js`, `*.json`, and directory modules (with or without package.json/main).\n* Functionality of `require` statements stay the same - loading on demand, loading once, and synthesizing the `module` global object.\n* Handling of cyclic references same as node.js's' native implementation\n* Using `include` option to include files which are not automatically detected (because of dynamic `require`s using variables and other complex loading mechanisms)\n* Loading modules which were specified using complex `require` statement (i.e. `require(moduleName + '_' + index)`)\n\n*Note*: Support for `require` of module folders (with parsing of `package.json` etc.) will be added in the future.\n\n## CoffeeScript\n\nIf you need support for CoffeScript, simply use Grunt to \"compile\" your Coffee files, and then run the optimizer on a pure JS project.\n\n## Binary modules\n\nThere's no simple way to embed native binary modules (*.node), or modules that depend on other local raw files.\nIn case you have a module which is known to have binary files, you should exclude it from optimization, and put it in a known path, or on a private NPM etc.\n\nI've tried to also support squashing `node_modules` for cases where one wants to eliminate the need of an `npm install` in a production project,\nbut I have abandon those trials, as it makes no sense:\nIn 99% of the cases on of the modules in the `node_modules` tree will have binaries, and `npm install`/`npm update` is a strength anyway as it allows for bugfixes even in a production project.\n\n## Grunt\n\nSee [https://github.com/danielgindi/grunt-node-optimize](https://github.com/danielgindi/grunt-node-optimize)\n\n\n## Contributing\n\nIf you have anything to contribute, or functionality that you luck - you are more than welcome to participate in this!  \nIf anyone wishes to contribute unit tests - that also would be great :-)\n\n## Me\n* Hi! I am Daniel Cohen Gindi. Or in short- Daniel.\n* danielgindi@gmail.com is my email address.\n* That's all you need to know.\n\n## Help\n\nIf you want to buy me a beer, you are very welcome to\n[![Donate](https://www.paypalobjects.com/en_US/i/btn/btn_donate_LG.gif)](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=G6CELS3E997ZE)\n Thanks :-)\n\n## License\n\nAll the code here is under MIT license.
